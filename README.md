## Usage
Welcome to Game Tracker! Users can manage their personal library of games with ease by using this app! When adding a game you are to write your own personal notes about it as well as give it a rating. You can upload screenshots to your game as well as mark wether or not you have completed it. Users may login with their own credentials or they can use Github to login.
